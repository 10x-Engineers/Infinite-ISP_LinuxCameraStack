# Infinite-ISP Support for PetaLinux

## Overview
 This project is part of the Infinite-ISP Linux-Based Camera Stack, which aims to provide a complete camera stack package, from camera application development to hardware ISP implementation on FPGA. Application development and FPGA implementation are complete, while writing the driver and integrating Infinite-ISP into Linux as a module are still in progress.
